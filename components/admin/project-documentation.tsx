ðŸŽ¯ Admin Dashboard Integration

The performance monitoring and documentation are fully integrated into the admin dashboard
with
:

- **Performance tab** showing real-time metrics and historical data
- **API Documentation tab**
with interactive explorer
- **Project
Documentation
tab**
with comprehensive guides
- Performance
alerts
and
notifications - Exportable

ðŸ“Š Key Metrics Tracked

- **Core Web Vitals**: CLS, FID, FCP, LCP, TTFB
- **Custom Metrics**: API response times, user interactions
- **Error Tracking**: JavaScript errors, API failures
- **User Experience**: Page load times, interaction delays
- **Resource Performance**: Image loading, script execution

The system automatically collects performance data, provides actionable insights, and helps maintain optimal app performance. The API documentation is comprehensive and developer-friendly, making it easy
for team members and external
developers
to
understand
and
integrate
with the DateCraft
platform.
